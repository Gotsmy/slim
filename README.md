# Sulfur limitation increases specific pDNA yield in *E. coli* fed-batch processes

Creation of models, simulation of processes, and analysis of data as discussed in our research paper available on ???.

## Scripts
Includes python scripts used for the dFBA simulations.
Unfortunately, the raw data results are not included as they take too much storage space.
However, you can re-generate them by running the scripts. (Change ``loc`` parameter first.)
Expect approximately 5GB per script results.

## Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks with code that was used to create the figures is given in the directory ``/notebooks``.

* ``00_model_creation.ipynb`` includes the model creation.
* ``01_analysis_1.ipynb`` includes code for figures 1 and 2.
* ``02_analysis_2.ipynb`` includes code for figures 3 and S1. 
* ``03_analysis_3.ipynb`` includes code for figures 4, 7, S2, S3, and S4.
